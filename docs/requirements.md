**Overview:**
Your task is to build a full-stack web application that integrates user-created content with interactive features. The application will allow users to create and manage posts, register and log in, and “like” posts.

# Requirements

1. Posts Management

   - Post Creation & Display:
     - [] Populate your database with 100 sample posts by fetching data from JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).
     - [] Allow users to create new posts. Each post should include, at minimum, a title and a body.
     - [] Display posts in a clean and organized list.

2. Post Interaction

   - Like/Unlike Functionality:
     - [] Once logged in, users should be able to like or unlike posts.
     - [] Liked posts should be visually distinct.
   - Liked Posts Management:
     - [] Provide a dedicated page or section where users can view all their liked posts.
     - [] Allow users to remove individual liked posts or clear all liked posts at once.

3. User Registration & Authentication

   - User Management:
     - [] Implement user registration and login functionality.
     - [] Ensure that only authenticated users can create posts, like posts, and access the liked posts management page.
   - Security:
     - [] Use secure authentication practices.

4. Data Persistence

   - Database:
     - [] Persist user data, posts, and liked posts in a database of your choice.
     - [] Design the data model with scalability in mind.

5. Bonus Features (Optional)

   - Filtering/Searching:
     - [] Add functionality to filter or search posts by title or content.
   - Performance & Scalability Enhancements:
     - [] Implement caching, lazy-loading, or other performance improvements.
   - Enhanced UI/UX:
     - [] Provide an engaging, responsive, and creative user interface.
   - Testing:
     - [] Include unit and/or integration tests for critical components of your
       application.
